  about: 
  - Technology is changing the way we interact with the world. We don't go online anymore. We exist there. Our smartphones and tablets are connected, of course, but soon things like traffic lights, machines, appliances, and autonomous cars will all be online.
  - These connections are all made possible by our unique network of communications infrastructure—towers, small cells, and fiber. They all work together to set the stage for new innovation—to bring the world's biggest ideas and possibilities to people and businesses who need them.
