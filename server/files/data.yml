  about:
    - Between 1971 and 1991, Dan Emmett and partners formed three real estate companies, which collaboratively engaged in the acquisition, development, redevelopment, operation and management of high-quality real estate assets within supply-constrained markets in Los Angeles County. While the early focus was on multifamily properties, the Company's investment focus evolved to include high-quality office properties and complementary retail space in California and Honolulu, Hawaii. Since 1993, Douglas Emmett has acquired a substantial majority of its portfolio through nine institutional funds.
    - Today, Douglas Emmett, through our interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, consolidated JVs and unconsolidated Funds owns and operates approximately 18.4 million square feet of Class A office space and 4,147 luxury apartment units in nine highly desirable submarkets in Los Angeles County, six of which are located in Los Angeles' Westside - Brentwood, Century City, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, the Olympic Corridor, and Westwood - and three submarkets in the San Fernando Valley - Sherman Oaks/Encino, Warner Center/Woodland Hills, and Burbank. The Company's Honolulu office portfolio is located in the downtown central business district with multifamily properties in nearby suburban communities.
    - The Company utilizes the same focused business strategy that was implemented by its founding principals - managing, developing, redeveloping and acquiring multifamily and commercial real estate in high barrier-to-entry submarkets that exhibit strong economic characteristics such as population and job growth, as well as inherent supply constraints, such as limited developable land due to natural and political barriers. The Company strives to capitalize on the experience of its seasoned management team to create continued value.
